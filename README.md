Contributing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contributions are more than welcome, be it for documentation, features, tests,
refactoring, you name it. If you are unsure of where to start, the [Code
Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/bmedici/pushyd) report will
provide you with improvement directions. And of course, if in doubt, do not
hesitate to open an issue. (Please note that this project has adopted a [code
of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).)

If you want your contribution to adopted in the smoothest and fastest way, don't
forget to:

* provide sufficient documentation in you commit and pull request
* add proper testing (we know full grown solid test coverage is still lacking and
  need to up the game)
* use the [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) guidelines provided
  (there are all sorts of editor integration plugins available)

So,

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Code
  * add proper tests if adding a feature
  * run the tests using `rake`
  * check for RuboCop style guide violations

4. Commit your changes
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)

6. Create new Pull Request
